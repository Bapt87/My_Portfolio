        <h2 class="main_h2">Why this Portfolio ?</h2>
          <div class="illustrated-paragraph">
            <div class="text-left">
              <p>As you may know, Data science is a very vast domain combining <b>mathematics</b>, <b>statistics</b>, <b>Data Analysis</b>, <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Deep Learning</b>.
              It is not an easy task to navigate blindly, and the chances of getting lost along the way are high.
              I would like this portfolio to alleviate this problem and serve as a guide as I progress in my career in Data Science.
              Indeed, in this portfolio I'm willing to share the <b>projects I'm undertaking in Data Science</b>, my way of working and how I operate.
              This portfolio is obviously not meant to be perfect but to be a tool to progress by practice.<br><br>

          <p>
              Moreover, as I already created once a website in the markup language <b>html</b> and the style sheet <b>css</b> for a course project,
              I was enthousiast to build my own web project and strenghten my basics in both html and css.

      <h2 class="main_h2">My Enthousiasm about Datascience</h2>
      <p>While I developped an analytical mind in <b>mathematics</b> classes during my preparatory class, I always missed the purpose of what I was learning.
          Indeed, the subjects covered, while being extremely interesting, did not have any direct domains of application for myself.
          Arriving in Neoma BS, I discovered a <b>Multivariate Data Approch</b> thanks to my courses.
          I started questionning myself about the mathematics concepts I already knew and discovered <b>mathematics applications</b> through Data Science during my internship at ITT360 GmbH in Germany.
          This domain instantly captivated me for its flexibility in the ways of resolving problems, <b>analysing datas</b>, <b>treating datas</b>, and modelling models. The possibilities are infinite.
          Moreover, I find this field fascinating for its <b>domain</b> diversity which I explained above.

        <div class="text-left">
          <p>In the following field, you will find a <b>selection of personnal projects</b> I carried out. This selection is meant to evolve as my career in this filed also evolves.
            In each project, you will always find an <b>article with snippets of code</b> integrated, in which I analyse the situation, do the pre processing and explain the way I'm resolving the project.
            The <b>Jupyter Notebook of my complete code</b> will also be available at the beginning of the article in form of a link.
