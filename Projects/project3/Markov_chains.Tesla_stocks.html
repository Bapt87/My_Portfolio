                        The goal of this project is to use the concept of Markov chains and apply it to TESLA stocks in order to detect some regularity and get an overview of the market. 
                        At the end, I create a pipeline enabling me to get very fast the same analysis for any company.

                        It is not an easy task to forecast stocks because we cannot only rely on the historicity of the market.
                        Indeed, World events, crises and spontaneous decisions make the task highly complex, and add an undeniable element of uncertainty to the stock forecasting process.
                        However, historical datas remain a strong element for analysis and one can recognize some patterns on the market.
                        These patterns do not take all factors into account, but they can serve as a reference point in certain situations where we need to take a stand.<br><br>

                        Today, I am not going to look into patterns in particular. Instead, I want to look into the ways to use Markov chains to determine the probability of an event occuring on the google stocks.

                <h2 class="secondary-title">How Markov chains work</h2>
                <div class="inside-text">
                    <p>
A Markov chain is a mathematical model that represents a system that evolves from one state to another, randomly, but with a limited memory:
The Markov property defines that the future state depends only on the present state, not on previous states.
The system can move from a present state to a future state thanks to transition probabilities given by a transition matrix.
If we take the example with three states occuring : A, B and C, and we give to each of the states a probability to occur, then the transition matrix is modelled as follows:
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="inside-image">
                    <img src="../../annex/annex_project3/Transition_matrix.png", alt="Transition matrix">
                </div>
                <div class="inside-text">
                    <p>
                        in this example, only one of the three elements occurs each day
                        Then, for example, when the start state is A,  we have a 80% to get also state A tomorrow, 10% that B occurs and 10% that C occurs.
                        Things get interesting when we want to predict further ahead in time. For example, we want to get the probability that state A in occuring in two days from the current state A. In this contexte, we get 3 possibilities :
                        <ul>
                            <li>A -> A -> A : 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64</li>
                            <li>A -> B -> A : 0.1 * 0.3 = 0.03</li>
                            <li>A -> C -> A : 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02</li>
                        </ul>
                        0.64 + 0.03 + 0.02 = 0.69 represents the probability that state A is occuring in two days.
                        Actually, you can see that this computing corresponds to the multiplication of the transition matrix by itself.
                        If we want the probability of the states occuring in a week from now, according to the markov chain, we have to multiply this matrix 7 times by itself.

                        Concerning the stocks market, I will suppose 5 different states in order to implement the Markov Chains in the Tesla stocks analysis :

I am going to use the non-official yahoo finance API which is named yfinance to get the stock prices from TESLA.
As it is an unoffcial API (this API scraps the html and json files of yahoo finance), this api is sensitive to changes on the yahoo site and this can lead to sudden errors.
To avoid a potential error, I will save the stock prices found in a parquet file. (parquet format in order to save memory and conserve Dtypes of Series). I will name this function get_and_save.
<br><br>
Before doing this, I'm going to retrieve a file containing the tickers for a number of companies as I'll need them to use the yfinance API.
I can get such a csv file (which I named Tickers_list.csv) from the Nasdaq website at this address: <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener">https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener</a>.

                        The probability displayed later on the transition matrix are going to highly rely on how we defined our 5 states. 
                        It is the most delicate part to determine these states.
                        The results can vary a lot depending on if for exemple a variation of 5% is considered as a slight increase or a big rise. <br>

                        Firstly, I initialized a matrix filled with 0.

                        And it adds a 1 to the change of state.
                        Then, at the end, we express these values as a percentage. 
                        For example, if we run the first iteration of the for loop, the variable "i" will take the value 2 and the variable "j" will take the value 1, then we add a 1 to the third row and second column of the matrix,
                        which corresponds to the change from ‘stagnation’ to ‘slight drop’.

The objective of long-term equilibrium is to get the probabilities of an event occuring in the long-run and not just for the next time.
To get that, we need to reach stationary distribution of the Markov Chains.
The Stationary distribution of the Markov Chain is when the system forgets its starting point and no matter the number of times the transition matrix is multiplicated, the output will always be the same.
In Stocks prediction, the stationarity distribution of the Markov Chains corresponds to the long-term equilibrium.
Stationary distribution is given by the stationary transition matrix. 
Let's compute the stationary transition matrix and determine from how many multiplications this matrix does not evolve anymore.

                        This function combines all the other functions implemented previously and let me automate the theroy of Markov Chains on the stock prices of any company.
                        The function returns each time the overview of the company's stock prices, its graphical representation, the current state of the market, the number of each state on this market and finally the transition matrix for the next event and the stationary transition matrix corresponding to the long-term equilibrium. <br>

                        Thanks to this project, I learnt how to apply the concept of Markov Chains on Stock Prices using Python.
                        It was challenging tu build such a project without pre-built packages and starting from scratch. 
                        I also learnt how to automate my work in order to apply it to other stock prices.
